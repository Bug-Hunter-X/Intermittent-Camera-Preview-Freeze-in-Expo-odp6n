This bug occurs when using the Expo Camera API with specific device configurations.  The camera preview freezes or fails to render correctly. This happens intermittently and isn't tied to a specific action within the app, making it difficult to reproduce consistently. The problem might stem from an incompatibility between the Expo Camera API and certain hardware or software combinations on the device or from resource constraints.  Additional debugging shows no clear errors in the console or network requests.
