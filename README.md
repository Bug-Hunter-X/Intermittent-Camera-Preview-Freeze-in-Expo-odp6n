# Expo Camera Preview Intermittency Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug where the Expo Camera API's preview intermittently freezes or fails to render correctly on certain devices. The issue is sporadic and challenging to reproduce reliably.  The code includes examples of the problematic behavior and a potential solution.

## Bug Description

The camera preview freezes or displays incorrectly, seemingly at random. No specific user actions consistently trigger the bug.  Console logs and network requests show no clear error messages.

## Reproduction

Reproducing this bug is inconsistent, even using the same device and conditions.  It likely relates to underlying device-specific factors or resource limitations.

## Solution (Partial)

The provided solution implements several strategies to mitigate the issue. These approaches aren't guaranteed to work in all cases due to the unpredictable nature of the bug but may improve reliability.
